This project involves programs to solve the following tasks:
  1. Compute the relative letter frequencies of 26 English letters across all data
  2. Compute the total number of printed words as a function of year. This information will be plotted to see if the total number of printed words has increased or decreased over the years
  3. Compute trends with a starting and ending year, and identify which words saw the greatest increase or decrease in usage in this timespan
  4. Find most similar words using the historical counts of words. The smaller the word count differences between words over the years, the more similar they will be considered
